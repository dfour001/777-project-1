# RunAnalysis.py contains functions that will be used to access the required
# geoprocessing tools.  The functions are organized in the order that they are
# run when the button to start the analysis is clicked.  The steps are:
#   - Prepare folder for first run if needed
#   - Interpolate nitrate levels from sample wells
#   - Summarize results of the nitrate interpolation at the tract level
#   - Update nitrates field in tracts shapefile
#   - Run OLS linear regression
